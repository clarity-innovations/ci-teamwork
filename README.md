# Teamwork Time Report

## Introduction

[Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/product/) is a hosted project management tool. Its built-in reporting only presents time-log data in a flat format, which makes it difficult to use for post-project time analysis. The `Teamwork Time Report` allows you to create a hierarchical project time data report that shows individual and aggregate task time, and allows for filtering by date, keyword, or hours logged.

## About the API We Use

This application makes use of version 1 of the Teamwork API. To use this application, you will need an active Teamwork account with API access and a valid API token. For more information on Teamwork's API, please see their [Developer Documentation](https://developer.teamwork.com/).
